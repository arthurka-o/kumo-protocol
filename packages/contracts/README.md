# @kumodao/contracts

This readme gives an overview of the contract package of the Kumo protocol.
This includes an overview of the general architecture of protocol, upgradability patterns, as well as deployment and test setup to onboard developers.


# Protocol
The Kumo stablecoin/borrowing protocol is a fork of Liquity, a battle-tested codebase to borrow money in the form of a stable coin against collateral. 

## Diamond Proxy Pattern


## Reasoning

## General set up
Kumo uses only one Diamond so far in the current development stage next to other contracts that are vanilla and non-upgradable.

## Storage Pattern


## Ownership and Permissions
